## Overview

This machine learning project predicts the price of real estate in Bangalore. It leverages various features of the properties, such as the number of BHK (bedrooms, halls, kitchens), the size of the house in square feet, and the location. A user-friendly interface allows users to enter these details and check the predicted price.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** A model trained on a dataset of real estate prices in Bangalore.
- **User Interface:** A web-based interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Predictions:** Real-time predictions based on user inputs.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on all devices.

## Usage

1. **Train the model:**
   - Open the `Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Run all cells to train the model and save the trained model.

2. **Start the front-end server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. **Access the web interface:**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.
   - Enter the details of the property to get the predicted price.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of various properties in Bangalore, with features including:

- Number of BHK
- Size in square feet
- Location
- Price

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before training the model.

## Model

The machine learning model is built using the following steps:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

The model is trained using algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

## Interface

The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input the number of BHK, size, and location of the house and get an estimated price instantly.
